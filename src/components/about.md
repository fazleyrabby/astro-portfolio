<p class="text-base">A passionate web developer & tech enthusiast from Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="text-base">With over three years of professional experience, I’ve built a variety of client projects and contributed on several projects for CodeCanyon. I enjoy crafting clean, efficient solutions — whether it’s a full-scale web app or a tiny helper module.
I’m also big on experimenting and building for fun. Currently, I’m working on Larabrix, a modular Laravel-based framework to make web development faster and more flexible.</p>
